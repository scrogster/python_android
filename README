Some simple scripts using Python 4 android

http://code.google.com/p/python-for-android/

1. pumping_android.py - script for checking if pumping water from the Yarra River is restricted/banned today.
borrows extensively from code in the Linux journal article http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10940?page=0,2 by Paul Barry

2. firealert_android.py - script which uses cfa rss feed to find current fire incidents close to home, and report relevant details
in android alert messages. The location of "Home" in this context is the Christmas Hills South Fire Station - code can easily be modified 
to reflect distances from any other desired location.Partly replicates functionality of the CFA fireready app, but in a low-bandwidth, 
minimalist format. Use at your own risk, no guarantee it will work for your required purpose.
